               <h4 align="center">A Japanese Cat Island</h4> 
               Aoshima Island is one of about a dozen "cat islands" around Japan, small places where there are significantly more feline residents than people. In Aoshima more than a hundred cats prowl the island, curling up in abandoned houses or strutting about in the quiet fishing village. Cats outnumber humans six to one on the island. Recently becoming popular online, tiny Aoshima has seen a steep rise in tourist visits, overwhelming the handful of permanent residents.

        <p>But what exactly makes Aoshima so special, and different from other cat islands? There are various reasons, but one of them is obvious as soon as you get off the boat, as a meowing welcome committee rushes up to greet you: the local feline population density. Just a couple years ago, there were some estimated 200 cats living on this tiny island. Various breeds are represented, with a large majority of orange and brown tabbies, as well as calicos.</br></br>
        Aoshima actually evolved into a “cat island” quite by accident. Several decades ago, it used to be a bustling fishing village whose livelihood was based around a sardine fishery, where cats were introduced to hunt mice. Over time, the island’s fishing activity declined, as did its human population, but the cats remained and thrived.</br></br>
