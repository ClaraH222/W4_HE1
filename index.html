           <h4>Sunrise at the Aoshima Shrine</h4> 
Nestled in and amongst a tropical forest on the small island of Aoshima and accessible by bridge, Aoshima Shrine is the main attraction in the area. Make sure you get there for amazing sunrise pictures of the big red torii gate. </br> </br>The island is a micro-climate, which means that the island is home to over 500 endemic species that can only be found on the island and in a few nearby areas in Kyushu . While most of the forest is fenced off from visitors, it can be explored via a series of paths leading off from the interior of the shrine. It is also well worth taking the path that circumnavigates the island to see the spectacular rock formations known locally as the "Devil's Washboard."

           <h4>Surfing in front of swaying palm trees</h4> 
           Aoshima is a surfer's paradise. Surfing is one of the main draws of Aoshima, and it has some of the most consistent waves in all of Japan. There are currently more than six surf schools and places to rent boards, most located along the beachfront. Most staff speak basic English, and they'll have you up on your board within the day. Coaching, wetsuits, boards, and accessories are all included in coaching packages, but can also be rented separately. Aoshima is well connected and can be reached by car, bus or train. Car is best if you're bringing your own surfboards.
